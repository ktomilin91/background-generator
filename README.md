# Boilerplate for React apps

A quick setup for developing React (and other) JavaScript apps.

## About

Utilizes [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for transpiling and bundling React and other JavaScript code for production. Features [webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) to quickly develop an application.

## Usage

Work on your code in the `./src` folder. 

To launch the Dev Server, use `npm start` command. It will open up a browser window with your application automatically.

To compile your code for producton, use `npm run build` command. 

Production-ready code will be added to the `./dist` folder.

## What`s inside

It comes with React, ReactDOM and Bootstrap modules by default. You may also want to instal Bootstrap's dependencies such as [jQuery](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jquery) and [Popper.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/popper.js?ref=vanillalist) in case you're planning to use its JavaScript features. Check out the contents of `./package.json` for the full list of packages that are already included into this Boilerplate.
